Savory Bites Restaurant Website – Project Documentation
1. Project Overview

The Restaurant Menu Website is a responsive, multi-page web application that presents a fictional restaurant’s offerings and brand story.
Its purpose is to demonstrate modern front-end web development skills—semantic HTML5, responsive CSS3, and interactive JavaScript—while providing visitors with an elegant and intuitive way to explore the menu and contact the restaurant.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages for easy public access and version control.

2. Objectives

Create a visually appealing website for a restaurant with separate pages for Home, Menu, About, and Contact.

Ensure mobile-first responsiveness so the layout adapts smoothly to phones, tablets, and desktops.

Add basic interactivity (navigation toggle and contact-form validation) using vanilla JavaScript.

Deploy the project on GitHub Pages to allow anyone to view it live.

3. Live Site

Once published through GitHub Pages, the project is accessible at:
